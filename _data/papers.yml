      Crowdwork platforms are central to the data supply chains that power AI systems, 
      particularly through large-scale data labeling, and they also sustain countless 
      academic, marketing, and political surveys. Despite this importance, the dynamics 
      of worker engagement remain poorly understood. Platforms face strong demand for 
      workers who can deliver fast and high-quality results, making retention critical—even 
      if the potential labor pool seems large, platforms actively compete to attract and 
      keep the most reliable workers.


      We study fairness and worker engagement on a large online crowdwork platform using 
      a comprehensive dataset that records approximately 64 million tasks completed between 
      January 2024 and May 2025. Focusing on new workers, we analyze how early experiences 
      shape subsequent activity. We examine two dimensions of procedural fairness: task 
      returns (process failures) and duration underestimation (information asymmetry). We 
      link submission records, study metadata, and dashboard data to reconstruct what each 
      worker saw before choosing a task. Using instrumental variable methods to address 
      endogeneity, we assess how early exposure to these frictions influences ongoing engagement.


      Our results show that early procedural frictions substantially reduce worker retention. 
      A 10 percentage point increase in returned tasks during the first 14 days reduces the 
      probability of remaining active by 3.8 percentage points. The effect of underestimation 
      is substantially larger: a 10 percentage point increase in underestimated tasks reduces 
      retention by 21 percentage points. Conditional on remaining active, we find no significant 
      effects on task volume, indicating that attrition rather than demotivation among survivors 
      is the primary channel through which frictions affect labor supply. These findings show 
      that process reliability and accurate information are critical for worker retention. The 
      implications are direct: improving early task experiences can reduce churn and help 
      platforms secure the reliable workforce they need in an increasingly competitive environment.

      The vast quantities of data required to build artificial intelligence (AI) technologies 
      are often annotated and processed manually, making human labor a critical component of 
      the AI supply chain. The workers who input this data are sourced through digital labor 
      (crowdwork) platforms that often are unregulated and offer low wages, raising concerns 
      about labor standards in AI development.
      Using the results of a survey, this article aims to shed light on the experiences and 
      perceptions of fair treatment among workers in the AI supply chain. The study reveals 
      significant variability in workers' experiences, identifies potential drivers of fairness, 
      and highlights how design choices by labor platforms can significantly affect worker welfare.
      Drawing on lessons from physical supply chains, this article offers practical guidance 
      to managers on how to enhance worker welfare within the AI supply chain and how to ensure 
      that AI technologies are responsibly sourced.

      Serendipity would seem to preclude purposeful search. To understand the relationship 
      between search behavior and the probability of a serendipitous discovery, we propose 
      a formal modeling framework based on the NK model.
      Our simulations suggest that searchers with a clear hypothesis convert good fortune 
      into fitness or value far more effectively. Searchers that pursue their theories through 
      incremental steps instead of long-distance jumps have the highest rates of serendipitous 
      success. Our model also provides insight into the role of bias, inaccurate or incorrect 
      beliefs, and the ruggedness of the terrain in determining the rate of serendipitous discovery.
      Our results demonstrate the distinct roles of intent and information in finding novel, 
      valuable discoveries.

      How do professionals respond to computerized, data-driven guidance in practice? We 
      analyze a workers' compensation insurance program where physicians make coverage and 
      diagnosis decisions. We study the introduction of an automated system that flagged 
      diagnoses with historically low coverage.
      We develop a model that yields testable predictions to distinguish between informational 
      and persuasive effects. Consistent with persuasion, physicians granted coverage less 
      often when confronted with alerts, but they also avoided alerts by recoding diagnoses. 
      Data from secondary reviews show that the system aligned physicians' decisions with 
      management's preferences.
      These findings provide lessons for the design of information systems for decision-makers.
