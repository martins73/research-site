      Crowdwork platforms are central to the data supply chains that power AI systems 
      and sustain large-scale academic and commercial research. Despite this importance,
      worker engagement dynamics remain poorly understood. We study how early procedural
      frictions shape retention using approximately 64 million task submissions from 
      Prolific. Focusing on new workers, we examine two frictions: task returns, reflecting
      study design failures, and duration underestimation, reflecting inaccurate platform 
      information. Using instrumental variables to address endogeneity, we find that a 
      10 percentage point increase in returned tasks reduces retention by 3.8 percentage 
      points, while the same increase in underestimated tasks reduces retention by 
      21 percentage points. Frictions operate through attrition rather than demotivation
      among survivors. Process reliability and accurate information are critical for 
      sustaining the engaged workforce platforms need to compete.

      The vast quantities of data required to build artificial intelligence (AI) technologies 
      are often annotated and processed manually, making human labor a critical component of 
      the AI supply chain. The workers who input this data are sourced through digital labor 
      (crowdwork) platforms that often are unregulated and offer low wages, raising concerns 
      about labor standards in AI development.
      Using the results of a survey, this article aims to shed light on the experiences and 
      perceptions of fair treatment among workers in the AI supply chain. The study reveals 
      significant variability in workers' experiences, identifies potential drivers of fairness, 
      and highlights how design choices by labor platforms can significantly affect worker welfare.
      Drawing on lessons from physical supply chains, this article offers practical guidance 
      to managers on how to enhance worker welfare within the AI supply chain and how to ensure 
      that AI technologies are responsibly sourced.

      Serendipity would seem to preclude purposeful search. To understand the relationship 
      between search behavior and the probability of a serendipitous discovery, we propose 
      a formal modeling framework based on the NK model.
      Our simulations suggest that searchers with a clear hypothesis convert good fortune 
      into fitness or value far more effectively. Searchers that pursue their theories through 
      incremental steps instead of long-distance jumps have the highest rates of serendipitous 
      success. Our model also provides insight into the role of bias, inaccurate or incorrect 
      beliefs, and the ruggedness of the terrain in determining the rate of serendipitous discovery.
      Our results demonstrate the distinct roles of intent and information in finding novel, 
      valuable discoveries.

      How do professionals respond to computerized, data-driven guidance in practice? We 
      analyze a workers' compensation insurance program where physicians make coverage and 
      diagnosis decisions. We study the introduction of an automated system that flagged 
      diagnoses with historically low coverage.
      We develop a model that yields testable predictions to distinguish between informational 
      and persuasive effects. Consistent with persuasion, physicians granted coverage less 
      often when confronted with alerts, but they also avoided alerts by recoding diagnoses. 
      Data from secondary reviews show that the system aligned physicians' decisions with 
      management's preferences.
      These findings provide lessons for the design of information systems for decision-makers.
