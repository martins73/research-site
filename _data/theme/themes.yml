# University Theme Presets
#
# Each theme provides accent colors for light and dark modes.
# To use: set "color_theme: ucla" (or any key below) in _config.yml
#
# Colors are derived from each university's official brand guidelines.
# accent_orange is consistent across themes (used for Job Market Paper tag).
