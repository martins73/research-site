## Local Development

Since this site uses pure HTML/CSS, you do not need to install Ruby or Jekyll.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/martins73/research-site.git](https://github.com/martins73/research-site.git)
    cd research-site
    ```

2.  **Preview the site:**
    You can simply open `index.html` in your browser. 
    
    *Optional (for better link testing):* Run a simple local server using Python (pre-installed on macOS):
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
    Then open `http://localhost:8000`.
