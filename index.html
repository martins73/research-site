    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="lead">I study the human supply chain of Artificial Intelligence.</p> 
    <p>AI relies on invisible human labor. My research examines <strong>crowdwork platforms</strong>—the digital assembly lines where workers label data and train algorithms. I use econometric methods to understand fairness, task estimation, and worker retention in these marketplaces.</p>
    <p>Before joining UCLA, I was the Head of Advanced Analytics at ACHS in Chile and a management consultant at Oliver Wyman. I hold an MBA from MIT Sloan.</p>
    <p>Beyond the research and the data, my life is defined by my family. I am incredibly fortunate to walk this path with my wife, Andrea, and our four children: Carlota, Martín, Joaquín, and Juan Pablo. They are my greatest joy, my daily chaos, and my most important responsibility.</p>

            Crowdwork platforms are central to the data supply chains that power AI systems, yet the dynamics of worker engagement remain poorly understood. Using a dataset of 64 million tasks, we analyze how early experiences—specifically procedural fairness and task underestimation—shape worker retention. Our results suggest that initial frictions substantially lower re-engagement rates, but those who remain have higher participation intensity.
