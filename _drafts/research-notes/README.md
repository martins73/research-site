# Research Notes System

## 🎯 The Goal
Write 1 short research note per week (600-800 words) about AI ethics, crowdwork, labor economics, and related topics. Develop your thinking, educate your audience, spark conversation.

## 📂 How to Use This Folder

### Files You'll Use
- **TEMPLATE.md** - Copy this every week to start a new post
- **ideas.md** - Your running tracker of topics, progress, and checklist

1. Open `ideas.md`
2. Scan recent papers, Twitter, arXiv in your fields:
   - Crowdwork/labor platform news
   - AI ethics debates

3. Pick ONE topic that interests you
4. Write it in "This Week's Topic" section
5. Jot down 2-3 key points

**Wednesday-Thursday (45 min): Write**

## ✨ Tips for Consistency

### Make It a Real Appointment
- Block "Tuesday 10am - Research notes time" on your calendar
- Recurring weekly reminder
- Treat it like a class you teach (non-negotiable)

### Remove Friction
- Don't overthink - aim for "clear & helpful," not perfect
- Use the template - no blank page paralysis
- Keep ideas.md open in your editor all week
- Write in Markdown in your favorite editor

### Track Your Progress
- Update ideas.md weekly - mark posts as done
- Watch your streak grow (motivated you to keep going)
- Share milestone: "10 posts written!" or "52 weeks in a row"

### Content Variety (Rotate Through These)
1. **Paper reactions** - Read a new paper, share your take
2. **Ethics & AI debates** - Comment on recent controversy
3. **Methodological insights** - "How to measure fairness"
4. **News commentary** - What does recent news mean?
5. **Reader questions** - Address questions from your field

## 🎓 Example Opening Lines (To Spark Ideas)

- "I just read a paper that challenges conventional wisdom about X..."
- "The latest news about [platform] shows a pattern most people are missing..."

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**"I don't know what to write about"**
→ Check arXiv, your field's Twitter, recent news. Pick something that made you curious.

**"This is taking too long"**
→ You're overthinking. 600 words = 20 minutes. Polish for 15 more. Done.

**"I missed a week"**
→ No problem. Don't catch up, just start again. Consistency matters more than perfection.

**"Should I publish these somewhere else too?"**
→ Not yet. Focus on building the habit first. Cross-posting can come later.

Good luck! You've got this. 🚀
