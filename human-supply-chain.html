        <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence is not magic. It is manufacturing.</strong></p>

        <p>We talk about AI as if it were a naturally occurring resource—mined from data lakes and refined by compute power. But this metaphor erases the most critical component of the assembly line: the human.</p>

        <div class="pull-quote">
            "Behind every 'autonomous' system is a human worker labeling the reality that the machine will eventually mimic."
        </div>

        <p>My research at UCLA Anderson focuses on this invisible infrastructure. I treat the training of AI models not as a computer science problem, but as a <strong>Supply Chain</strong> problem. We have raw materials (unlabeled data), bottlenecks (human attention), inventory costs (latency), and quality control issues (bias).</p>

        <p>Just as the industrial revolution required us to study the factory floor, the AI revolution requires us to study the <strong>Crowdwork Platform</strong>. This is where the work happens. It is where the ethics of fair pay collide with the mathematics of estimation.</p>

        <p>We cannot optimize what we refuse to see.</p>
