    <h2>Teaching Statement</h2>
    
    <p>My journey into academia was not traditional. After five years as a Management Consultant and four years as the Head of Advanced Analytics at a large healthcare network in Chile, I returned to the university environment inspired by the mentors who shaped my own career. These professors did more than transfer knowledge; they facilitated my personal growth and helped me navigate the complexities of the real world. As an educator, I am driven by that same purpose: to find joy in the interactions with my students and to help them see the impact of their decisions on their companies, their peers, and society.</p>

    <p>Because of my background, I view the classroom as a bridge between abstract theory and professional practice. I do not simply teach concepts; I leverage my corporate experience to make those concepts tangible. I am a firm believer in "learning by doing". I design assignments that require students to actively engage with the material rather than passively consume it. For instance, during my time in the industry, I fostered collaborations with universities, including hosting a project for the MIT Analytics Lab where students solved live business problems using our data. I am committed to bringing these types of real-world challenges into my curriculum, ensuring that students leave my class with skills they can apply immediately.</p>

    <p>In fields like Operations and Data Analytics, technical skills are only half the equation. My teaching places a heavy emphasis on critical thinking and ethical decision-making. I challenge my students to consider the broader consequences of their work—not just the "how", but the "why". I also advocate for the thoughtful integration of technology. We cannot ignore tools like Generative AI; instead, I encourage students to use them in their assignments to understand both their capabilities and their limitations. My goal is to prepare them for a future where these tools are ubiquitous, but where human judgment remains paramount.</p>

    <p>Looking forward, I am particularly interested in teaching <strong>Data Analytics</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> courses. These subjects are the perfect venue to demonstrate the power of advanced analytics while tackling the ethical issues that arise with new technologies. I hope to inspire my students to leverage data not just to drive innovation, but to make informed, responsible decisions in their careers.</p>
